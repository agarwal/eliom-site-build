This is a temporary project to experiment with a new build script for Eliom.

Type `make` to compile and run the site. It will be running at
[http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082).


The ocamlbuild plugin requires `solvuu_build`. You'll need to install
that by doing:

      opam pin add solvuu_build https://github.com/solvuu/solvuu_build.git
